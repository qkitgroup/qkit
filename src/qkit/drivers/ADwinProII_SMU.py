    """
    The ADwin Pro II by JÃ¤ger Computergesteuerte Messtechnik GmbH provides slots for various 
    ADC/DAC or data in/out cards as well as an accessable FPGA-like processor for control. Our
    group's device currently has a 4-channel 16-bit ADC, a 50kHz filtered 8-channel 16-bit ADC 
    and an 8-channel 16-bit DAC card. Getting the device running requires some steps outlined
    below:

    - Selecting drivers from https://www.adwin.de/de/download/download.html. Installing the 
      full software package is recommended for potential debugging, analyzing timings, etc.
    - 'pip install ADwin' to the qkit virtual environment. (Note: despite being present, the 
      driver could not correctly read out the ADwin install directory from the windows registry
      on my machine. To fix this, I commented out the entire try/except block around line ~100 
      in *venv*/site-packages/ADwin.py and hardcoded 'self.ADwindir = *adwin_install_path*')
    - The tool *adwin_install_path*/Tools/ADconfig/ADconfig.exe finds ADwin devices in the 
      network and allows e.g. assigning their MAC-addresses to a fixed IP-address. This should
      already be done for this device. In either case one still needs to register it as an 
      adwin-device on the measurement pc and assign it an adwin-device-number (default: 1)
    - With *adwin_install_path*/Tools/Test/ADpro/ADpro.exe one can check if communication with
      device is now possible & what the id-numbers of the used cards are (should be 1, 2, 3)
    - For usage one needs to provide a bootloader and to be run processes. The bootloader can 
      be found under *adwin_install_path*/ADwin12.btl for the T12 processor type. This driver 
      is in particular designed around 2 processes which configure the FPGA as a default SMU.
      If you're still reading this your problem can't be solved any other way but with this 
      box, so at this point I wish you good luck with whatever is troubling you. The already 
      compiled processes can be found as .TCx-files alongside the other files on the exchange 
      under exchange/Devices/ADwinProII/ and should be provided somewhere on the measurement pc. 

    SMU_SingleSetGet.TC1 enables ADC/DAC access by checking in regular intervals if a  
    respective action is requested. SMU_SweepLoop.TC2 is a high-priority process for sweeping 
    over a given array and reading back a given signal. The speed of one step is mostly limited 
    by the ADC/DAC access commands taking up to ~1600 CPU cycles = ~1.6e-6 s. The source code 
    for these processes is provided in the .bas-files. Alternatively one can program the FPGA 
    to do whatever one wants but then this driver obviously will no longer work with it.
