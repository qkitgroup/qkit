In the future, this folder will contain the new qkit core derived from qtlab.
The goal of this is to make qkit standalone.

Work in progress by AS, YS, and HR in the dedicated branch.

ToDo:
    + get the core starting with the qtlab init routine without pygtk
    + get rid of hardcoded locations in config.py and init/02_qtlab_start.py
    + remove gui and other unused code
    + test measurement
    - revise what has to be removed from .cfg on startup (user_insdir?)
    - move source/plot_engines/qtgnuplot somewhere into qkit (used by qkit/measure/timedomain)
      or switch timedomain to qviewkit
    - include installation requirements into the qkit README (see old readme_012015.txt in comment to github issue)
    - rewrite the communication part
    - cleanup of unused code
    - check for global variables and move into qckit container (done for _config, what about _instruments?)
    - create userconfig_local.py
    + reorganize folder structure
    - qtlab -> qkit_core (qt. -> qc.)
    - implement new basic gui showing the (measurement)status and settings
      based on qviewkit?
    - include start script/notebook into qkit

    YS: started with contents of working qtlab folder from pi-us61 "qtlab-15a460b_notebook"

09.05.2017
    YS: installed Python and qkit on dedicated test notebook
    YS: removed .pyc files, 3rd_party and instrument_plugins

10.05.2017
    YS: try to start the environment with the 000_qtlab_start notebook
        fail because of missing gobject from pygtk, which is 32bit

11.05.2017
    YS: source/instrument.py: lib.network.object_sharer no longer imported
        class instrument previously inherited SharedGObject (from object_sharer)
        check which features were used besides emit!
    YS: remove gobject references in source/qtflow.py
        as with instrument.py: what else was used from SharedGObect?
        remove GTK references in source/qtflow.py
        mainloop commented since no events expected, seems to only wait for unused GTK gui
    YS: remove gobject references in source/instruments.py
        as with instrument.py: what else was used from SharedGObect?
    YS: source/qt.py: removed source/data.py and source/plot.py reference
        both are no longer used or replaced by qkit methods
    YS: init/02_qtlab_start.py: hardcoded config location adapted to new qtlab_core
        this should not be hardcoded!
    YS: remove gobject references in init/02_qtlab_start.py
        mainly object_sharer initialization
    YS: init/02_qtlab_start.py: removed source/data.py and source/plot.py reference 
    YS: deactivated gui in init/02_qtlab_start.py
    YS: remove gobject references in 98_started.py
        only object_sharer exit handler
    YS: source/lib/config.py: hardcoded directory adapted
        this should not be hardcoded!
    YS: init/00_lockfile.py: hardcoded directory adapted
        this should not be hardcoded!
    YS: userconfig.py: hardcoded directory adapted
        this should not be hardcoded!
    AS: 02_qtlab_start.py: Commented unnecessary qt.msleep in line 72
    AS: userconfig.py: Commented all references to qtlab_addons, which is overhauled
    AS: first successful run of start script

12.05.2017
    HR: shifted init scripts to make room before lock
    HR: removed orphaned file T1s.dat
    YS: source/instruments.py: removed references to hid
    YS: source/instruments.py: deactivated 'proxy'
    AS&YS: first successful tests:
        mw_src and fsup can be controlled
        tawg hangs while instruments.create, unclear where or why
    YS: remove example folder
    YS: .gitignore
    YS: removed deprecated startscripts qtlab, qtlab.bat and ipython.bat
        we use ipython notebooks
    YS: VERSION (beta 0.2 since first successful test, derived from qtlab pre v0.3.1)
    YS: removed deprecated AUTHORS (included in VERSION), MANUAL, INSTALL and CHANGELOG
    YS: removed GUI (source/gui folder, qtlabgui.bat, qtlabgui.cfg, qtlabgui, source/lib/gui dolder)
    YS: integrated unused options from userconfig_old.py into userconfig.py as comments
        and removed userconfig_old.py
    YS: removed readme_012015.txt with installation notes by JB and S1 and moved to git issue
    YS: removed source/data.py and source/plot.py
        both are deprecated and replaced by newer qkit methods
        and both were deactivated in source/qt.py
    YS: removed source/plot_engines folder
        used only by timedomain? and should be replaced by qviewkit
        
15.05.2017
    HR: removed addons folder

02.06.2017
    HR: zmq based info_service
    
09.06.2017
    HR: closing gui via qkit info system now possible

13.06.2017
    YS: refurbished folder hierarchy (core.source and core.source.lib now directly in core and core.lib)
    YS: core.qkit renamed to core.qcorekit to prevent name collision
	YS: removed unused qtrun.py
	YS: removed lib/math folder containing unused fit and peakfind scripts
	YS: removed unused scripts.py and references to it in qt.py
	YS: removed lib/com_support,dll_support, and file_support folders providing unused scripts for device communication
	
14.06.2017
	YS: core.lib.config.py and core.init.14_qtlab_start.py: remove hardcoded paths
    
16.06.2017
    YS: core.userconfig: removed scriptdirs key
    YS: init.99_init_user: removed scripts imported
    YS: changed some startup prints
    YS: NOTE: %cd C:\qkit\qkit\core required before running qtlab_shell!
    
19.06.2017
    YS: write path to core directory into core.qcorekit
    YS, AS: new runinit script getting rid of the deprecated shell references in qtlab_shell
    
20.06.2017
    YS: fixing bug with global _config variable: only available in the storage it was first created in!
    YS: therefore necessary to have very consistent import statements (i.e. no mixing of qkit.core.lib.... and lib....)

21.06.2017
    YS: move config into qckit.config
    YS: import problems when importing qkit.core.qt as qt in instrument
    YS: therefore in instrument still import qt (is found as in same dir as script)
    YS: related to import loop problem? reproducible externally with test1.py and test2.py importing eachother "as"
    YS: remove chdir in 99_init_user
    YS: add coredir to sys.path as otherwise drivers don't find their import "from instrument import Instrument"
    YS: imports have to be refurbished! workaround for this import loop? somehow possible to hand over qt from global storage into instrument?
    
22.06.2017
    YS: implemented local userconfig file userconfig_local.py, which is not synced
    YS: replace import qt in instruments by directly imported get_flowcontrol from qtflow
